	''' This object keeps the mapping between caps data and real disco
	features they represent, and provides simple way to query that info.
	It is application-wide, that is there's one object for all
	connections.
	Goals:
	 * handle storing/retrieving info from database
	 * cache info in memory
	 * expose simple interface
	Properties:
	 * one object for all connections (move to logger.py?)
	 * store info efficiently (a set() of urls -- we can assume there won't be
	   too much of these, ensure that (X,Y,Z1) and (X,Y,Z2) has different
	   features.

	Connections with other objects: (TODO)

	Interface:

	# object creation
	>>> cc=CapsCache(logger_object)

	>>> caps = ('sha-1', '66/0NaeaBKkwk85efJTGmU47vXI=')
	>>> muc = 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc'
	>>> chatstates = 'http://jabber.org/protocol/chatstates'

	# setting data
	>>> cc[caps].identities = [{'category':'client', 'type':'pc'}]
	>>> cc[caps].features = [muc]

	# retrieving data
	>>> muc in cc[caps].features
	True
	>>> chatstates in cc[caps].features
	False
	>>> cc[caps].identities
	[{'category': 'client', 'type': 'pc'}]
	>>> x = cc[caps] # more efficient if making several queries for one set of caps
	ATypicalBlackBoxObject
	>>> muc in x.features
	True
