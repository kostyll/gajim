Welcome and thanks for trying out Gajim.

Runtime Requirements:
python2.4 (python2.3 should work too)
pygtk2.6 (pytgtk 2.4 should work too)
python-libglade

Compile-time Requirements:
python-dev
libgtk2.0-dev
libxss-dev (for idle)

Optionally:
GnomePythonExtras 2.10 or above (so you can avoid compliling trayicon and gtkspell)

Luckily most of the runtime requirements are met by any modern distro.

INSTALL PROCEDURE
tar jxvf gajim-version.tar.bz2
cd gajim
make
make install # as superuser

RUN GAJIM
gajim

or if you didn't 'make install' you can also run from gajim folder with
./launch.sh


Enjoy!
