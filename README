Welcome and thanks for trying out Gajim.

REQUIREMENTS
python2.4 (python2.3 should work too)
pygtk2.6 (pytgtk 2.4 should work too)
python-libglade

Optionally:
GnomePythonExtras 2.10 or above

If you have GnomePythonExtras then you don't need to 'make' for trayicon support.
You still have to 'make' if you want auto-away detection.
Luckily most of the requirements are met by any modern distro.

INSTALL PROCEDURE
tar jxvf gajim-version.tar.bz2
cd gajim
make
make install # as superuser

RUN GAJIM
gajim

or if you don't 'make install' you can also run from gajim folder with
./gajim.py

TROUBLESHOOTING
If you have python2.3 please manually edit plugins/gtkgui/Makefile and in
CFLAGS line replace python2.4 to python2.3


Enjoy!
